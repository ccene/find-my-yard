The pursuit of Housiness in Leeds area - with data from local council


I wil try to build this webapp in React, might take a bit as I am just starting with React.

The general idea is to have a webApp where you can : 
    1. Find in depth details about a house you might be interested in. (AgeBand,BuildForm,SystemType,PropertyType,MainWallConstruction).
    2. Reverse search if a property is listed on other property listing websites such as RightToMove,Zoopla using filters such as: AgeBand -> show all the availlable properties in that age band in relations to available data.
    
    We want to buy a house, Leeds seems like a good fit and this tool is actually usefull, I use it in a crude form right now. 
    Creating this tool, will also add some more skill and ease of access while searching.
